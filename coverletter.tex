\lettersection{About Me}
It is my dream to be able to contribute to the energy transition in global level. That is the reason for me to pursue my master in MSc. Complex System Engineering and Management Delft Technical University, after working for seven years in automation with Schneider Electric. I started to work in Schneider Electric after I graduated with cumlaude predicate from Engineering Physics in Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB). In this study I needed to be able to work with Java, C++, Matlab, and IEC611313 programming language to work on various control application, which then ease me to work in Schneider Electric 2011 to 2018. 

I started as an Automation Engineer who are responsible to work with Power Management System (including servers and databases configurations), PLC, industrial networking architecture (gateway, hub, and switches), HMI, and SCADA. I love my job that allows my technical knowledge to be relevant. Then, my curiosity help me to diversify my roles within the automation division. In the end, this passion lead me to be the leader of the automation team at the end of 2017. 

I decided to further my education and expand my knowledge in the energy transition with a master that focus on the complexity of the European energy system in 2018. On the side, my master has also allow me to try new programming languages such as Phyton, R, and NetLogo.

On top of that, my experience has made me understand that being up to date to the current software capability is essential to keep up with the volatility of the energy system. The only way to keep us is to keep on learning and trying new things everytime new challenges appear. Thus, I strive to keep on learning new skills and concepts such as Linux and Docker. 

\lettersection{Why me for the all around software engineer at ABB?}
As a multinational company who work toward energy transition, ABB is one of the best opportunity that I can join to follow my dream to contribute better to the energy transition. With my capability, technicality, and most importantly, curiosity, I believe I can be a good fit to be the all around software engineer. In my experience, I believe that although knowledge can be essential as an all around engineer, I think curiosity and positive attitude are what make people strive. I believe I can offer ABB both for this position.    

In conclusion, I believe my motivation and capabilities are useful for the position of all around software engineer at ABB. I think my technical capabilities that was taken from from my seven years experience building automation system for various industry (with Schneider Electric)  as well as my study in both BSc. Engineering Physics and MSc. Complex System Engineering and Management can give me sufficient provision to work in this position. And most importantly, I believe that my mindset on continuous learning that has been proven in both my education and my previous career will help me being a good all around software engineer at ABB.

Thank you for your kind attention. I will be happy to answer any question that you have for me. I am looking forward to hearing from you.
